# Blog Rails 8.0.1

This is a blog build using Ruby on Rails 8.0.1 to substitute my blog in
alanmaciel.mx buid in Jekyll.

## Objectives
I need a blog that can be updated easylly and that can be integrated with
MD, so I can post frequently and with the same format I use in my personal
notes and writings.

I'm thinking in converting this to a Gem so I can easily install it in any
ROR project where I need a blog.

This Blog also needs to have a small bio and my CV (maybe accessible only 
with a password).

## Features

This blog has the following features:

* Follows the Rails 8 new way of doing things.

* Is simple to install and use.

* The design is clean and simple.

* Posts can be searched in an easy way.

* Posts are organized by year, month.

* You can post MD articles without fuzz.

## Installing
To get the application up and running:

* Install Ruby and Rails on your machine (I use mise to mmanage 
Ruby versions).

* Create the database and run the migrations.

* Load the seed data.
